<horatio> A peece of him
<barnardo> Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellus
<marcellus> What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night
<barnardo> I haue seene nothing
<marcellus> Horatio saies, 'tis but our Fantasie,
<marcellus> And will not let beleefe take hold of him
<marcellus> Touching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,
<marcellus> Therefore I haue intreated him along
<marcellus> With vs, to watch the minutes of this Night,
<marcellus> That if againe this Apparition come,
<marcellus> He may approue our eyes, and speake to it
<horatio> Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare
<barnardo> Sit downe a-while,
<barnardo> And let vs once againe assaile your eares,
<barnardo> That are so fortified against our Story,
<barnardo> What we two Nights haue seene
<horatio> Well, sit we downe,
<horatio> And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this
<barnardo> Last night of all,
<barnardo> When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole
<barnardo> Had made his course t' illume that part of Heauen
<barnardo> Where now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe,
<barnardo> The Bell then beating one
<marcellus> Peace, breake thee of:
JOIN ghost
<marcellus> Looke where it comes againe
<barnardo> In the same figure, like the King that's dead
<marcellus> Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio
<barnardo> Lookes it not like the King? Marke it Horatio
<horatio> Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder
<barnardo> It would be spoke too
<marcellus> Question it Horatio
<horatio> What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,
<horatio> Together with that Faire and Warlike forme
<horatio> In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke
<horatio> Did sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake
<marcellus> It is offended
<barnardo> See, it stalkes away
<horatio> Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.

<marcellus> 'Tis gone, and will not answer
<barnardo> How now Horatio? You tremble & look pale:
<barnardo> Is not this something more then Fantasie?
<barnardo> What thinke you on't?
<horatio> Before my God, I might not this beleeue
<horatio> Without the sensible and true auouch
<horatio> Of mine owne eyes
<marcellus> Is it not like the King?
<horatio> As thou art to thy selfe,
<horatio> Such was the very Armour he had on,
<horatio> When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted:
<horatio> So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle
<horatio> He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.
<horatio> 'Tis strange
<marcellus> Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,
<marcellus> With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch
<horatio> In what particular thought to work, I know not:
<horatio> But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,
<horatio> This boades some strange erruption to our State
<marcellus> Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes
<marcellus> Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch,
<marcellus> So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,
<marcellus> And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon
<marcellus> And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:
<marcellus> Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske
<marcellus> Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,
<marcellus> What might be toward, that this sweaty hast
<marcellus> Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:
<marcellus> Who is't that can informe me?
<horatio> That can I,
<horatio> At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,
<horatio> Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,
<horatio> Was (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway,
<horatio> (Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)
<horatio> Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet,
<horatio> (For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)
<horatio> Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,
<horatio> Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,
<horatio> Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands
<horatio> Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:
<horatio> Against the which, a Moity competent
<horatio> Was gaged by our King: which had return'd
<horatio> To the Inheritance of Fortinbras,
<horatio> Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant
<horatio> And carriage of the Article designe,
<horatio> His fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras,
<horatio> Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,
<horatio> Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,
<horatio> Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,
<horatio> For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize
<horatio> That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other
<horatio> (And it doth well appeare vnto our State)
<horatio> But to recouer of vs by strong hand
<horatio> And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands
<horatio> So by his Father lost: and this (I take it)
<horatio> Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,
<horatio> The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head
<horatio> Of this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.

<horatio> But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:
<horatio> Ile crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion:
<horatio> If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,
<horatio> Speake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,
<horatio> That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.
<horatio> If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate
<horatio> (Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.
<horatio> Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life
<horatio> Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,
<horatio> (For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)
<horatio> Speake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus
<marcellus> Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?
<horatio> Do, if it will not stand
<barnardo> 'Tis heere
<horatio> 'Tis heere
<marcellus> 'Tis gone.

<marcellus> We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall
<marcellus> To offer it the shew of Violence,
<marcellus> For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,
<marcellus> And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery
<barnardo> It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew
<horatio> And then it started, like a guilty thing
<horatio> Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,
<horatio> The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,
<horatio> Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate
<horatio> Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,
<horatio> Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,
<horatio> Th' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes
<horatio> To his Confine. And of the truth heerein,
<horatio> This present Obiect made probation
<marcellus> It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.
<marcellus> Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes
<marcellus> Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,
<marcellus> The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:
<marcellus> And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,
<marcellus> The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,
<marcellus> No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:
<marcellus> So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time
<horatio> So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.
<horatio> But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,
<horatio> Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,
<horatio> Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice
<horatio> Let vs impart what we haue seene to night
<horatio> Vnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,
<horatio> This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:
<horatio> Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
<horatio> As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?
<marcellus> Let do't I pray, and I this morning know
<marcellus> Where we shall finde him most conueniently.

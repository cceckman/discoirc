# Contributing

Want to contribute to `discoirc`? Great!

Take a look at the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and
[issues](https://github.com/cceckman/discoirc/issues) pages for things to work
on, if you don't have anything in mind; and keep in mind the [goals](VISION.md)
of `discoirc`. (If you disagree with that vision, start an issue thread, and we can have a respectful discourse.)

PRs are welcome, especially if tracked against an existing issue.

Also consider contributing to one of the upstream projects:

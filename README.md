# discoirc
A text-based IRC client.

## What's the name from?
It was very briefly called 'discourirc', as in the French
[discourir](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/discourir), 'to discus'.

But that was too many letters and less memorable for English speakers (like the
author).

## Why not irssi?
Because I understand neither the configuration language nor Perl, and wanted to
make make something.

In particular, to make something well-documented.

## Components

* discod is the main component. It's a daemon that holds on to the server
  connection, listens for events, runs user scripts (Lua),
  fills in the buffers of windows, etc.
* discoirc, a terminal frontend for discod.
  It's recommended to install this as 'irc'.

## discod
discod 
* reads 
  * configuration: default settings, preferences, whatever.
  * script files
* executes 
  * scripts, which may create, modify, intercept, etc. windows.
  * automatic commands, like connecting to a server
* persists
  * sessions to servers (and thereby chatnets)
  * sessions to channels (i.e. recent logs; optionally, all logs, to disk.)
  * sessions to plugins - whatever may be generated by plugin scripts.
  * views: what discoirc has open, where it's scrolled to.

## discoirc
discoirc does its best to abdicate window management out of the terminal, and
into, you know, and actual WM.

* <Mod> + ? shows a 'help' menu.
* <Mod> + / shows the window list: what windows are open.
  A window 
Keybindings - <Mod> + (L,R,U,D,1..0) - can be used to switch between

## Dependencies

* Config & scripting Interfaces
  * https://github.com/golang/protobuf for internal data structures & config.
  * https://github.com/Shopify/go-lua for (Lua) scripting
  * Or maybe other things at https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#configuration
* IRC
  * https://github.com/fluffle/goirc for IRC connections.
* UI
  * https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui for discoirc UI.
  * https://github.com/gizak/termui isn't particuarly useful, but it looks cool.
* Build
  * https://glide.sh/ maybe? I do like having dependencies at known versions.
* Model after
  * https://github.com/cantino/huginn for plugins (maybe).

## Difficult things to do
* Unicode support, overall.
* RTL support in particular.
